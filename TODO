1) Add motor noise and capture signals
2) Add on-screen graphics - buttons icons, distance to target
3) Add auto-color-pick algorithm
4) Add range sensor
5) Add encoder motors
6) Add image filtering and clustering: denoise, clasterize, pick the largest
7) Add tags, remove outdated stuff, fix algorithm implementation: specialize template, move static data to allocated
8) Optimize memcpy's (v4l2 with our cams, fb&qt - to be designed)
9) Create multiple DSP worker threads and combine them with memcpy's?
10) If not, create two sets of DSP buffer and mix them - this way it might speed up DSP's cache flushes
